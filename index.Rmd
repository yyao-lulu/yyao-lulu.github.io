I am currently a second-year master student at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/), with a major in Biostatistics (Theory & Method Track). I graduated from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) in June 2017, with a BS in Food Science and Engineering. Some of my projects during my graduate study in Columbia are [here](projects.html). For more about my professional and academic experience, please see my  [resume](about.html).

You may reach out to me via email on the upper-right corner of the page, as well as my Linkedin and Github account.
